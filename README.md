# Apple Watch Studio UI Clone

## Overview

This project is a pixel-perfect clone of the **Apple Watch Studio** experience, developed using **Next.js** and **TypeScript**. It replicates the seamless watch customization process available on [Apple Watch Studio](https://www.apple.com/shop/studio/apple-watch). The goal is to provide an interactive experience where users can customize their Apple Watch with real-time updates to the watch preview, price, and various configuration options.

## Features

- **Case Selection**: Interactive grid of available Apple Watch cases in different materials (e.g., Aluminum, Titanium).
- **Size Selection**: Toggle between different sizes (e.g., 41mm, 45mm) and dynamically update the watch preview and price.
- **Band Selection**: Carousel for selecting different band styles and colors.
- **Collection Switching**: Dropdown/modal to switch between different collections (e.g., Series 10, Herm√®s, SE).
- **Real-Time Price Updates**: The total price updates dynamically based on user selections.
- **Save and Share Functionality**: Ability to save and share the customized configuration via URL or social platforms.
- **Animations and Smooth Transitions**: Fluid animations for hover effects, size changes, and component transitions.
- **Mobile-First Responsive Design**: Ensures optimal performance and accessibility on all device sizes.

5. File/Directory Explanation
/components: Contains the main UI components that handle user interactions, like selecting a watch case, size, and band.
/lib: Contains utility functions for image management and other business logic.
/public: Stores all the static assets, including images for the watch cases, bands, and faces.
/pages: Defines the landing page (index.tsx) and the customization page (customization.tsx).
/styles: Contains global and component-specific styles. Tailwind CSS is used for styling.
6. Dependencies
This project uses the following key dependencies:

Next.js: For the React-based framework and server-side rendering.
TypeScript: For static typing and better code maintainability.
Framer Motion: For smooth animations and transitions.
Tailwind CSS: For utility-first styling.
shadcn/ui: For reusable, accessible UI components.
React Context API: For managing global state across components.
Adding Watch Images
To make the watch images visible, ensure the following directories and files are in place within the /public directory:

Watch Case Images: /public/watches/

Example: aluminum-midnight-41.png, aluminum-starlight-45.png
Watch Face Images: /public/faces/

Example: series-10.png, ultra-2.png, se.png
Watch Band Images: /public/bands/

Example: solo-loop-midnight.png, sport-band-midnight.png
You can replace the placeholder images with high-quality assets in these directories.

Key Considerations
Performance: Ensure the images are optimized for the web to avoid long loading times.
Accessibility: Use ARIA roles and keyboard navigation for an inclusive user experience.
Mobile Responsiveness: Test the UI on mobile and tablet to ensure it's fully responsive.
SEO: Add relevant metadata, titles, and alt text for better search engine optimization.
